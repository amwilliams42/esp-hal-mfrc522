# MFRC522-esp-hal
Non-blocking RFID library for esp-hal (maybe for other hal's in the future).
This project is just "port" of [this Arduino Library](https://github.com/OSSLibraries/Arduino_MFRC522v2).

## What works
- [x] SPI communication
- [x] PICC_Select for 4/7/10 byte UIDs
- [x] Mifare auth
- [x] Reading data
- [ ] Writing data
- [ ] All debug functions
